# Introduction to HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
The structure of a HTML page involves the following elements:

-   `<!DOCTYPE html>` - specifies the version of the HTML the page uses
-   `<html></html/>` - This is the root element
-   `<head></head>` - This is where we add metadata about the application we are building. It consists of information that we do not want included as part of the actual page content
-   `<body></body>` - This contains all the content that you want to show to web users

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>Document Title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This is all the content to be displayed to users</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
